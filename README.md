# Gan-backend-code-application

This is my code submission for the Gan Integrity, Backend coding challenge.

To run the program and show the results, you need to do the following:
1. Download the project from GitHub.
2. Extract the zip's content and go into the folder.
3. Extract the addresses.zip so you get a .json file.
4. Now do ```npm install``` to get the required packages. !Make sure you have npm otherwise install it!
5. Now open two terminals and write the following in the first terminal: ```npm run server``` and write the following in the second terminal ```npm run start```.
6. After some seconds you should be greeted by this message in the second terminal: ```You made it! Now make your code available on git and send us a link```.
7. Now you are done :)
